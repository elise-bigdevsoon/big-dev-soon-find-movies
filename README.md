# Find Movies Project

Hello to [BigDevSoon](https://bigdevsoon.me/) ðŸ‘‹

Create a visually appealing application that allows users to search for movies and TV series by title and view their details. Challenge yourself to incorporate a "Featured Today" and a "Premieres and announcements" section. Integration with a third-party API adds an extra level of complexity to the project.

## How to start

1. Start the project in our [app](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/) to get a feel for it.
2. Review the requirements listed below in this README.
3. Go through the design images on the [project's page](https://app.bigdevsoon.me/projects/find-movies) and import the `.fig` file into Figma to understand the layout and design elements.
4. Clone this repository or use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to set up the project environment.
5. Choose your preferred technology stack and overwrite repository files as needed to set up your project structure. We included a few files and the `assets` folder for convenience, extracted from the design.
6. Begin coding, either using the Freerun mode to work on each card individually or the Speedrun mode to work at your own pace. Be sure to follow the guidelines outlined below.
7. Have a strong desire to learn and improve your skills as a Big Developer. ðŸš€

## Requirements

- [ ] Start by researching and exploring an API such as [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/), studying its documentation to understand what data it returns, and configuring it with your API key. Use images from the API for rendering movie and series posters.
- [ ] Add a movies search bar with debouncing, loading, and empty states for search results to the navigation, along with a logo, showing around 5 results.
- [ ] Create a "Featured Today" section on the homepage, with tabs for Movies and Series, displaying around 20 random movies and series. Add infinity scroll left and right functionality for browsing through titles.
- [ ] Implement a "Premieres and announcements" section on the homepage, similar to "Featured Today" but filtered by year (e.g. 2023) and without tabs. Add infinity scroll left and right functionality for browsing through titles.
- [ ] When a user clicks on a movie or series, open the details page in a separate URL, allowing for refreshing and separate browsing.
- [ ] Add skeleton animation loading to both pages for a better user experience.
- [ ] Handle API request failures by showing only the navigation and error boundary page.

## Guidelines

1. Aim for pixel-perfect implementation of the design. Use tools like [PixelParallel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelparallel-by-htmlburg/iffnoibnepbcloaaagchjonfplimpkob?hl=en) or other techniques to ensure accuracy.
2. Write clean and efficient code. Use extensions like [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for formatting and errors, and consider using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor.
3. Follow a [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). Keep your commits small and descriptive, organize your work into separate branches, and use pull requests for code reviews.

Remember, the cleaner and more accurate your code is, the faster you can finish and the better you'll feel about your work.
So let's make it happen! ðŸ’¡

## Submitting project

Once you've completed the project and unlocked the Submit step in our app, it's time to deploy your project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (if you haven't done so already). Keep in mind that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file, and we'll check for it when you submit your Project URL. So don't forget to include it! You'll also need to provide the project title and the primary frontend technology used. Good luck!

## We're in Beta and getting better every day!

Hey there, Big Developer! We wanted to take a moment to thank you for participating in our project and helping us improve our platform. We're always looking for ways to make our app better, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to let us know.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
